## 🛠️ What I Learned

- How to **use SVG elements** and change their colors on hover.
- How to **import fonts from a local folder** using `@font-face`.
- Created the basic HTML structure, but most of the content is **generated dynamically with JavaScript** instead of hardcoding.
- How to **fetch data from a JSON file** and display it dynamically.
- How to create an **overlay effect** for order confirmation and make the background **unscrollable** while it is visible.

## ⚡ Challenges

- Figuring out how to manage the **Add, increase and decrease buttons** correctly.
- Making the **overlay and order section** appear properly on top of the page content.
